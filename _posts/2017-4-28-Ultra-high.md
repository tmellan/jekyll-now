title: Temperature-induced intrinsic defects at the melting point
---

This gif shows the formation of a carbon interstitial defect near the melting point. 
In this particular rocksalt-structred ceramic, that comes in just under 4000K.
As a point of reference that is most of the way to the surface temperature of our nearest star, or the temperature of light from a hospital-white LED strip.
