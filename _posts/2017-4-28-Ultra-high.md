title: Temperature-induced intrinsic defects at the melting point
---

A carbon interstitial defect forms in this crystal (look towards the front! and watch the loop several times), in what is essentially the start of the melting process.
For this rocksalt-structred heavy-weight of the ceramic world, the melting point weighs in at just under 4000K.
As a point of reference, that is somewhere between surface temperature of our nearest star, and your nearest warm LED.
