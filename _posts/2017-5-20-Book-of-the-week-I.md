title: Book of the week - I
---

This week, while reading around phonons and Goldstone bosons, I followed a link to Setha"'"s stat mech book which nicely combines both in one paragraph. The text, "Entropy, Order Parameters and Complexity" can be downloaded (for free) from his website, which is something I liked so much, I ordered a copy of the real thing.

So far I have only had an hour or two to skim through but the book is great. It has a casual style of writing that I find particularly quick and easy to read. High-point sections so far include:
- Why stochastic errors scale like N^-0.5 - very relevant for MD simulations
- Goldstone theorem - enlightening in the context of lattice dynamics
- Algorithms for practical computations e.g. Monte Carlo Metropolis
- Fluctuations, Cauchy theorem, and causality - of fundamental importance
